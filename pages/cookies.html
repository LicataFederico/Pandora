        This Cookie Policy supplements the information contained in the Privacy Policy by explaining how we and our
        business partners and services providers use cookies and related technologies in the course of managing and

        <h4>Your Choices About Cookies <strong style="font-weight: 100;">If you would prefer not
                to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when
                you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies;
                or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies. Please note that doing so may negatively
                impact your experience using our online services, as some features and services on our online services
                may not work properly. In addition, if you want to reject cookies across all your browsers and devices,
                you will need to do so on each browser on each device you actively use. Depending on your device and
                operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies. You may also set your email
                options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us
                to know whether you have accessed our email and performed certain functions with it.

        <p></p>

        <h4>Controlling Cookies and Tracking Technologies. <strong style="font-weight: lighter;">Most browsers allow you
                to adjust your browser
                settings to: (i) notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept
                it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies. Blocking
                or deleting cookies may negatively impact your experience using the Service, as some features and
                services may not work properly. Depending on your mobile device and operating system, you may not be
                able to delete or block all tracking technologies. You may set your e-mail options to prevent the
                automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you
                viewed or engaged with our emails.</strong></h4>



        <h4>Interest-Based Advertising. <strong style="font-weight: lighter;">We support the self-regulatory principles
                for online advertising (Principles) published by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). This means that
                we allow you to exercise choice regarding the collection of information about your online activities
                over time and across third-party websites for online interest-based advertising purposes. More
                information about these Principles can be found at www.aboutads.info. If you want to opt out of
                receiving online interest-based advertisements on your internet browser from advertisers and third
                parties that participate in the DAA program and perform advertising-related services for us and our
                partners, please follow the instructions to place an opt-out cookie on your device indicating that you
                do not want to receive interest-based advertisements. Opt-out cookies only work on the internet browser
                and device they are downloaded onto. If you want to opt out of interest-based advertisements across all
                your browsers and devices, you will need to opt out on each browser on each device you actively use. If
                you delete cookies on your device generally, you will need to opt out again.</strong></h4>

        <p>Please note that when you opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no
            longer see advertisements from us or on our online services. It means that the online ads that you do see
            from DAA program participants should not be based on your interests. We are not responsible for the
            effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of
            their statements regarding their programs. In addition, third parties may still use cookies to collect
            information about your use of our online services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as
            any other purpose permitted under the DAA’s Principles.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Updates to This Cookie Policy</h3>

        <p>We will update this Cookie Policy from time to time. When we make changes to this Cookie Policy, we will
            change the "Last Updated" date at the beginning of this Notice. If we make material changes to this Notice,
            we will notify you by email to your registered email address, by prominent posting on this website or our
            online services, or through other appropriate communication channels. All changes shall be effective from
            the date of publication unless otherwise provided in the notification.</p>
