            <h4>Your Choices About Cookies <strong style="font-weight: 100;">If you would prefer not
                    to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you
                    when
                    you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing
                    cookies;
                    or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies. Please note that doing so may negatively
                    impact your experience using our online services, as some features and services on our online
                    services
                    may not work properly. In addition, if you want to reject cookies across all your browsers and
                    devices,
                    you will need to do so on each browser on each device you actively use. Depending on your device and
                    operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies. You may also set your email
                    options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would

            <h4>Controlling Cookies and Tracking Technologies. <strong style="font-weight: lighter;">Most browsers allow

                    to adjust your browser
                    settings to: (i) notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to
                    accept
                    it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies.
                    Blocking

                    viewed or engaged with our emails.</strong></h4>



            <h4>Interest-Based Advertising. <strong style="font-weight: lighter;">We support the self-regulatory

                    for online advertising (Principles) published by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). This means
                    that
                    we allow you to exercise choice regarding the collection of information about your online activities
                    over time and across third-party websites for online interest-based advertising purposes. More
                    information about these Principles can be found at www.aboutads.info. If you want to opt out of
                    receiving online interest-based advertisements on your internet browser from advertisers and third
                    parties that participate in the DAA program and perform advertising-related services for us and our
                    partners, please follow the instructions to place an opt-out cookie on your device indicating that
                    you
                    do not want to receive interest-based advertisements. Opt-out cookies only work on the internet
                    browser
                    and device they are downloaded onto. If you want to opt out of interest-based advertisements across
                    all
                    your browsers and devices, you will need to opt out on each browser on each device you actively use.
                    If
                    you delete cookies on your device generally, you will need to opt out again.</strong></h4>

            <p>Please note that when you opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will
                no
                longer see advertisements from us or on our online services. It means that the online ads that you do
                see
                from DAA program participants should not be based on your interests. We are not responsible for the
                effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of
                their statements regarding their programs. In addition, third parties may still use cookies to collect
                information about your use of our online services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well
                as
                any other purpose permitted under the DAA’s Principles.</p>
